## consistenthash

consistenthash is an implementation of a consistent hash in Go

This technique is explained in these links:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing

http://www.tomkleinpeter.com/2008/03/17/programmers-toolbox-part-3-consistent-hashing/

There is also a popular existing quality Go implementation here:

https://github.com/stathat/consistent

This package is not a copy of that and was developed clean-room from
the wikipedia article. Check out that link also if you are evaluating
software to provide this functionality.
